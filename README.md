Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

My repository contains the course project work for "Getting and Cleaning data" Coursera project.

run_analysis.R script is doing the following -

a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
e) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

As mentioned in the project guidelines, this script assumes that the Samsung data is extracted.

run_analysis_download_data_first.R is the script same as run_analysis.R however it downloads and extracts data.
